# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Currently working on Rock Paper Scissors Game that run in browser console.
I plan to revisit this project in the future to improve and add Graphical User Interface.

Rule of the game:
- Open your browser console
- The input prompt will appear in the top-center of your screen
- Type in one of the options listed (Rock, Paper, Scissors)
- Press OK
- The Computer will randomly generate one of the options
- It will determine the winner and display the result
- Finally, the Game will run in loop for 5 times.

Enjoy!
